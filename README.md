# Portfolio for Carlos Martos
## Background
Greetings to all!

I am a software developer in Tulsa, OK with a passion for .NET and database development.
This portfolio is meant to give a little insight into my background as a software engineer. Please feel free to provide feedback or open issues

My portfolio currently lives here: https://www.carlosmartos.com/

## Credit
My beautiful portfolio began as an open-source template by github user saadpasta and several contributors to his developerFolio project. I believe in crediting authors and so I would like to give them credit and respect for maintaining incredible source code for free. https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio

## Deployment
This solution is deployed via: npm run deploy
