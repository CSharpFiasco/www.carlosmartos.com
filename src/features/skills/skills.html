          With {{ skillsSection.firstWorkingDate | yearsSinceDate }} years of experience as a software developer, I have a strong background
          in creating applications, including web and desktop applications, background services, and ETLs. Additionally,
          I excel in the design of relational databases. My testing strategy encompasses the use of Cypress for end-to-end
          testing, complemented by Jasmine and xUnit for thorough unit testing.
